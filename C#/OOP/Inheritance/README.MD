Inheritance: code reuse. Relationship and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enable development to reuse the 
common logic, which still maintain the unique hierarchy.

Allow classes to inherit from other classes which support reusability.

Benefit of Inheritance:
Can create a generic parent class, then create more specific child class.  Child class given automatically acccess to functionality with the parent class.
