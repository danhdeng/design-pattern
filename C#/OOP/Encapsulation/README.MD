Encapsulation
this principle states all important information is contained inside an object. and only select information is exposed.

Private/internal interface: methods and properties accessbile from other methods of the same class

Public/external interface: methods and properties accessbile outside of class.

benefits of Encapsulation:

1. add security: only public methods and attributes are accessbile from outside.
2. Protected against common mistake: prevent accidental changes from outside.
3. protect IPs: code is hidden. only public methods can be accesible from outside.
4. Supportable:
5. Hide complexity: No one can see what is behide the object contain.
