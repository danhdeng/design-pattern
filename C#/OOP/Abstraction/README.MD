Abstraction:is using simple class to represent complexity. it is an entension of encapsulation.

Only reveal internal mechanism that are is relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation coce. 

User only interact with selected attributes and method of an object.

Abstraction: 
1. use simplied high level tools to access complex object.
2. hide complex detail from the user.

Example of Abstraction

you did not have to know about the engine to drive a car.

benefit of abstraction:

1. simple high level user interfaces
2. complex code is hidden
3. security
4. easy software maintainance.
5. code update rarely change abstraction. since the high level modules do not depend on the low level modules.

high level modules focus on business rules/logic
lower level modules deal with  detail operation.
