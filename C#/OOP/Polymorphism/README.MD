Polymorphism

Design objects to share behaviors using inhertance. Object can override shared parent behaviors with specifc child behaviors. They can take on more than one form, allowing different type of objects to pass through the same interface

Polymorphim allow some methods to execute different behaviors in two different ways:
1. method overriding : child has different implementation logic
2. method overloading: methods/functions with same name, but different nubmer of parameters, different results may return.

Benefits of Polymorphism:
1. object of different types can be passed through the same interface
2. method overriding
3. method overloading.
