DIP(Dependency Inversion Principle)

1. the DIP stated that high level classes should not depend on the  low level classes. Both of them should depend on the abstraction.

2. Abstraction should not depend on the details. Details should depend on abstraction.

Higher level classes implment business rule or logic.

Lower level classes foucs on detail operation, such as writing information to DB, passing information to services.

Dependency injection is the implementation of Dependecy Inversion Principle.
