OCP(Open and closed Principle)

the class is open for extensions which is adding new functionality.
and closed for modification whhich should alter a class until a fbug is found.

we can use abstraction of dependencies (Interface and abstract class) rather than the concrete class. then we can 
add new functionaltiy by creating a new class to implement the interface or absctract class.
